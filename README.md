# mlb-questionnaires

This repository is a collection of questionnaires that I comleted in the process of interviewing for MLB internships in Fall 2018. These responses include wither R markdown files, Jupyter notebooks in Python, and SQL queries. Several of these projects include data visualizing and model building. Each submission is dated in order to track my model building progression. The models include strikeout rate prediction, swinging strike prediction, and several cases of pitch classification. They are imnplemented in both R and Python using logistic regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost. 

The order of completion from oldest to most recent:

1. Yankees
2. Phillies
3. Braves
4. Mariners
